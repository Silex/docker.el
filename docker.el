;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows you to manipulate docker images, containers & more from Emacs.

;;; Code:

(require 'docker-compose)
(require 'docker-container)
(require 'docker-image)
(require 'docker-machine)
(require 'docker-network)
(require 'docker-volume)

(defun docker-read-log-level (prompt &rest _args)
  "Read the docker log level using PROMPT."
  (completing-read prompt '(debug info warn error fatal)))

(defun docker-read-certificate (prompt &optional initial-input _history)
  "Wrapper around `read-file-name'."
  (read-file-name prompt nil nil t initial-input (apply-partially 'string-match ".*\\.pem")))
